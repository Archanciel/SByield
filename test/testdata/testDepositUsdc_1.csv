Comment: The very first deposit must be defined with a date which is one day before the first Swissborg yield payment. The other deposits are defined with a date equal to their first Swissborg yield payment. if an owner makes several deposits for the yield farm crypto on the same
date, add only one row for this owner with a value equal to the sum of those deposits.
If more than one deposit for different owners are added on the same date, each deposit
date must be unique, i.e. with a second component augmented by 1 (10:00:00, 10:00:01, ...) !
