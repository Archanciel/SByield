Comment: All deposits or withdrawals contained in a deposit csv file are for the same yield farming currency. The deposits must be defined with a deposit date which is equal to the first SB earning date for this deposit with 00:00:00 for the time component.
To describe it differently, the deposit date is equal to the yield subscription activation date + 1 day. If an owner makes several deposits for the same yield farming crypto on the same date, only one row for this owner with a value equal to the sum of those
deposits must be added to the csv file. If more than one deposit for different owners are added on the same date, each deposit date must be unique,
i.e. with a time component augmented by 1 second for each addition (00:00:00, 00:00:01, etc) !
