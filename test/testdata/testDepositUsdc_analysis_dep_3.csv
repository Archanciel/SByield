Explanations:
1/ All deposits or withdrawals contained in a deposit csv file are for the same
   yield farming currency.
2/ The deposits must be defined with a deposit date which is equal to the first SB
   earning payment date for this deposit with 00:00:00 for the time component.

   To describe it differently, the deposit date is equal to the yield subscription
   activation date + 1 day. Once a yield subscription is active, it starts to generate
   daily revenues. The first of those revenues is paid 1 day after the activation date.

   If an owner makes several deposits for the same yield farming currency on the same
   date, only one row for this owner with a value equal to the sum of those deposits
   must be added to the csv file.

   If more than one deposit for different owners are added on the same date, each
   deposit date must be unique, i.e. with a time component augmented by 1 second for
   each addition (00:00:00, 00:00:01, etc) !
