Explanations:

1/ All deposits or withdrawals contained in a deposit csv file are for the same
   yield farming currency (USDC, CHSB, ETH, ...).

2/ Deposits are positive and withdrawals negative

3/ The deposits or withdrawals must be defined with a date which is equal to the first.
   respectively the last + 1 day, SB earning payment date for this deposit/withdrawal with
   00:00:00 for the time component.

   To describe it differently, the csv file deposit date is equal to the yield subscription
   activation date + 1 day. Once a yield subscription is active, it starts generating
   daily revenues. The first of those revenues is paid 1 day AFTER the activation date.
   This justifies the fact that the csv file deposit date is 1 day after the activation
   day.

   For withdrawals, the csv file withdrawal date is equal to the yield redemption
   fulfilment date + 1 day. Once a yield redemption is fulfilled, it stops generating
   daily revenues the day AFTER the fulfilment date. So, since the withdrawal
   amount still generates a revenue on the redemption fulfilment date, its csv file
   withdrawal date 1 day after the yield redemption fulfilment date.

   If an owner makes several deposits/withdrawals for the same yield farming currency on
   the same date, only one row for this owner with a value equal to the sum of those
   deposits/withdrawals must be added to the csv file.

   If more than one deposit/withdrawal for different owners are added on the same date,
   since each deposit/withdrawal date must be unique, the same day deposit/withdrawal date
   must be defined with a time component increased by 1 second for each added deposit/withdrawal
   row. Example: 00:00:00, 00:00:01, 00:00:02.

Test case info:

Multi owners, 1 withdrawal. Owner with 1 deposit at LAST yield payment date of
2020/12/30 and at LAST position alphabetically. TWO owners with multi deposits/
withdrawal.
